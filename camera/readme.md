# Camera

This directory contains instructions on how to set up the camera with the Jetson Nano along with some example code.   
Start with [setup.md](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/blob/main/camera/setup.md), followed by the [Stream](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/blob/main/camera/Stream.ipynb) and [WaggleStream](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/blob/main/camera/WaggleStream.ipynb) notebooks. Or, feel free to check out the notebooks and directory in your own order!   
    
Afterwards, head back to the [main page](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu) to explore the [microphone](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/tree/main/microphone), [enviSensor](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/tree/main/enviSensor), and [projects](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/tree/main/projects) directories.
