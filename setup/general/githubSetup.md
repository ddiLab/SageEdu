## Setting up a local repository from Github

 1. Create a directory on the computer to store the repository. Preferably, use the same one where the virtual environment directory is stored if you chose to create one
 2. Go to the "<> Code" section of the repository on [Github](github.com)
 3. Select the green box marked with the install logo and "Code" next to it
 4. Go to "HTTPS" and copy the URL
 5. Go to the terminal of the nano and within the directory from step 1, run the command `$ git clone [URL LINK]`
 6. Enter your username and password
	 1. Note: if your Github account is protected by 2FA, generate an access token to use as your password
7. You now have a clone of that Github repository on your machine!
