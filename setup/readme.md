# Jetson Nano Setup

This directory contains instructions on how to perform the initial set up of the Jetson Nano.

The setup can be performed in either headful or headless modes. The mode you decide to use for the setup is not binding. Once the Nano is setup you can switch between headfull and headless modes as you wish. Now, get started with either one:

### [Headful Mode](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/tree/main/setup/headful)
Requires the use of a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and another computer. 
Setting up the Nano headful allows it to be used by interacting with a GUI.

### [Headless Mode](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/tree/main/setup/headless)
Only requires the use of another computer. Setting up the Nano headless will require that the Nano be used solely through a command line interface.

After completing the steps in either directory above, head to the [general](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/tree/main/setup/general) directory to further customize the nano.
