# AC_Detector directory
This folder contains installation instructions for creating a virtual environment to house all the work done in this directory, installing an audio analysis library, and developing an AC detector using AI and data analysis   
Get started with 
1. [setup](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/blob/main/projects/AC_Detector/setup.md). Afterwards
2. [reviewing a pyAudioAnalysis tutorial](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/blob/main/projects/AC_Detector/pyAudioAnalysisIntroduction.ipynb)

And afterwards, explore the directory!
