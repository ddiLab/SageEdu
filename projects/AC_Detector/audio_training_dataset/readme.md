## [test_audio/](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/blob/main/projects/AC_Detector/audio_training_dataset/test_audio)
* includes a few audio files to test the classification abilities of the AI model developed in the `TrainingAIModel.ipynb` notebook

## [heartbeat_sounds/](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/blob/main/projects/AC_Detector/audio_training_dataset/heartbeat_sounds)
* includes files used to train the heartbeat detector model
* and location where future data from the `TrainingAIModel.ipynb` will be stored
