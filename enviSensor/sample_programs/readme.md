# Environmental Sensor Sample Programs

This directory contains basic programs that make use of the environmental sensor.

## Directory Contents:

### [collectData.py](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/blob/dev/enviSensor/sample_programs/collectData.py)
* A python script that takes readings of humidity, air pressure, temperature, and gas resistance and saves it to a csv file
* Run the script by running the following command:  
  `python3 collectData.py BURN_IN_DELAY MAX_BURN_IN_TIME RUN_DELAY MAX_TIME FILE_NAME`    
  * `BURN_IN_DELAY` is the number of seconds between readings during the burn-in process
  * `MAX_BURN_IN_TIME` is the maximum number of minutes you want the sensor to burn in
  * `RUN_DELAY` is the number of seconds between measurements
  * `MAX_TIME` is the maximum number of minutes you want the data collection to last
  * `FILE_NAME` is the name of the file you want the date to be stored in. This should end in ".csv"
* For example, run the following command to burn in for 20 minutes at two second intervals and then collect data for an hour at five second intervals and save it to a file called `hour_data.csv`:  
    `python3 collectData.py 2 20 5 60 'hour_data.csv'`
* These files are stored in the `collected_data/` directory
* The reason the run times are specified as maxmimums is to limit the sensor and processes behind gathering data to that timeframe

### [Data Plots.ipynb](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/blob/dev/enviSensor/sample_programs/Data%20Plots.ipynb)
* Notebook containing plots of various datasets collected using the sensor 
* These datasets are stored in the `collected_data/` directory

### [changeAlert.ipynb](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/blob/dev/enviSensor/sample_programs/changeAlert.ipynb)
* A jupyter notebook containing code that calculates the normal state of the current environment and then alerts you in live time if there are abnormal changes in that environment

### [burnInPlots.ipynb](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/blob/dev/enviSensor/sample_programs/burnInPlots.ipynb)
* A jupyter notebook containing plots of the datasets collected from various burn-in tests and reasoning on how long a sensor burn-in should last
* These datasets are stored in the `collected_data/` directory

### [collected_data/](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/tree/dev/enviSensor/sample_programs/collected_data)
* A directory containing data in .csv format used throughout this directory (`sample_programs/`)
* Note: the files labeled "burn-in-test-X.csv" are not in the timestamp protocol generated by the `collectData.py` script
