CameraAudioWaggle.py:
    Python program that is able to save just video footage without any audio from the camera into the current directory using the Waggle platform
    There are comments outlining possible methods of also including audio, but errors arise when using ffmpeg's libx264 with opencv
        The error might be fixable by changing some .config files of opencv
