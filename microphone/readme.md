# Microphone

This directory contains instructions on how to set up the microphone with the Jetson Nano along with some example code/notebooks.  
Start with the [setup instructions](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/blob/main/microphone/setup.md), followed by the [ReadRecordAudio](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/blob/main/microphone/ReadRecordAudio.ipynb), [WaggleAudio](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/blob/main/microphone/WaggleAudio.ipynb), [CameraAudio](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/blob/main/microphone/CameraAudio.ipynb) notebooks, and [sample_programs](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/blob/main/microphone/sample_programs) directory. Or, feel free to check out the notebooks and directory in your own order!   

Afterwards, head back to the [main page](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu) to explore the [camera](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/tree/main/camera), [enviSensor](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/tree/main/enviSensor), and [projects](https://github.com/ddiLab/SageEdu/tree/main/projects) directories.
